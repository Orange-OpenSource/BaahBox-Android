## The aim of the project

The _Baah Box_ project has been created so as to provide to inpatent children and adults a fun solution to use so as to train their muscles or arms.  
Indeed some people can have a missing arm, and are equiped by a prothesis. They need training to discover and train the muscles needed to controle the prothesis.  
Also people can be injuried and have to train again their muscles, arms or hands so as to recover their capabilities.  

## The products

The common training tools are not fun, there are no games. We provide with Baah Box a solution with:

* an Android app
* an iOS app
* a box with Arduino ships and a 3D printable shield
* a lovely assets


Sensors or joystick have to be plugged to the box communicating with the apps using Bluetooth Low Energy.
