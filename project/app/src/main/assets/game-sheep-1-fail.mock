# Format should be A=value;B=value;J=value
# where value is a positive integer and sensor is A or B or J (for Joystick.)
# For sheep game, and also for games which have animations (toad, space sheep, but not star and balloon)
# we should smooth the values with small increments.
# In fact we values are not smoothed, thus if increments are too high, they may be seen as parasites
# and finally avoided.
